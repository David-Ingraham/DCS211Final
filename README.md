# DCS211Final

Goals:

          The website is a proof of concept for a project that lets people anonousmously aggregate thier financial transactions. 
          
          Why might people want this?
          
          With enough users, and I mean a lot of users, we can group all the transactions by retailer/recipient. This will give us an idea how much a       
          certain retailer like walmart has made over time. 
          
          A retail trader looking for a company with good revenue can only get this information 4 times a year. This website aims to give retail traders 
          daily revenue data for consumer-facing public companies.
